"""AI onboarding interviewer core (issue #804).

A pure, Django-independent callable that drives one turn of a
conversational onboarding interview. The view/HTTP layer (and the future
#809 eval runner) is a thin wrapper: it loads the persisted transcript +
persona catalog from the ORM, calls :func:`run_onboarding_turn`, persists
the new turn, and -- on completion -- writes the standard #800
``Response`` / ``Answer`` rows.

Django-independence is a hard contract. This module imports neither
``django.db`` models, nor ``request`` objects, nor the ``accounts`` /
``plans`` apps. Its only dependencies are the provider-neutral LLM
service from #799 (:mod:`integrations.services.llm`) and Pydantic. An
import-isolation test enforces this so #809 can wrap it without dragging
in the request layer.

Structured output uses the #799 pattern: the
:class:`OnboardingExtraction` Pydantic model doubles as the tool input
schema via ``model_json_schema()``; on the final turn the model returns
its answer as a single tool call whose validated input is the
extraction.

Persona names (Alex / Priya / Sam / Taylor) are INTERNAL. The system
prompt instructs the assistant to reason in archetype terms only and
never surface a persona name to the member; the ``persona_signal`` field
is the internal signal stored staff-side, never echoed to the member.

    "You are a warm, focused onboarding interviewer for a hands-on AI "
    "engineering cohort program. Your job is to interview a new member in a "
    "short conversation so the team can build them a personalised 6-8 week "
    "plan.\n\n"
    "Interview guidance:\n"
    "- Infer the member's archetype from their engineering comfort, their "
    "AI/ML comfort, and whether they have shipped/deployed a project -- not "
    "from self-classification alone. Roughly a third of members are blends; "
    "do not force a single label.\n"
    "- Ask about accountability needs and what blocks their consistency "
    "early and concretely -- these are the most load-bearing answers.\n"
    "- Push the member toward ONE concrete project with an explicit "
    "in-scope and out-of-scope; if they have several ideas, help them pick "
    "one and defer the rest.\n"
    "- Capture how their weekly time behaves (steady vs variable vs "
    "front-loaded), not just an average number of hours.\n"
    "- Clarify how they want to use coding agents: some want a low-effort "
    "agent fallback, others explicitly want to learn without treating AI as "
    "a black box. Do not assume.\n"
    "- Surface evaluation as a likely depth gap for members who already "
    "ship AI or come from research.\n"
    "- Ask one focused question at a time; acknowledge the previous answer "
    "briefly before moving on. Keep the whole interview to a handful of "
    "turns.\n\n"
    "Tailor the interview to ONE working archetype:\n"
    "- After the first couple of answers (enough to read engineering "
    "comfort, AI/ML comfort, and shipped/deployed status), COMMIT to a "
    "single working archetype from the catalog below and treat it as your "
    "hypothesis for the rest of the interview. You may revise it if later "
    "answers clearly contradict it, but do not keep all archetypes open.\n"
    "- Once committed, PRIORITISE that archetype's delta questions (the "
    "questions listed only under that archetype) and draw your follow-ups "
    "from them. Do NOT ask the other archetypes' delta questions -- those "
    "belong to different members.\n"
    "- ALWAYS still ask the shared-spine questions (listed once below under "
    '"Shared spine"); they apply to every member regardless of archetype.\n'
    "- If the member is a genuine blend or none of the archetypes fit, fall "
    "back to the shared spine plus the most relevant deltas, and record the "
    'signal as "blend"/"other" at the end.\n\n'
    "Hard rules:\n"
    "- Speak in plain archetype descriptions. NEVER mention or imply any "
    "internal persona codename (the names Alex, Priya, Sam, Taylor are "
    "internal and must never appear in anything you say to the member).\n"
    "- When you have gathered enough to populate a plan, tell the member "
    "the interview is complete in a friendly sentence, and call the "
    '"' + "record_onboarding" + '" tool with the structured extraction. '
    "Do not call the tool before the interview is complete."

    """Stream one onboarding turn: yield text deltas, then the result.

    Streaming counterpart to :func:`run_onboarding_turn`. It is a
    generator that yields incremental ``str`` text deltas as the model
    produces the conversational reply, and finally yields a single
    :class:`OnboardingTurnResult` (the LAST item) that is IDENTICAL in
    shape to what :func:`run_onboarding_turn` produces for the same input.

    Single-generation contract (issue #821): one streaming turn makes
    exactly ONE model generation. The tool schema is attached to the
    ``llm.stream(...)`` call, so the SAME generation that produces the
    streamed conversational deltas also produces the structured tool call
    on the final turn. The authoritative :class:`OnboardingTurnResult` is
    assembled from that single generation's terminal ``done`` event — there
    is no second ``llm.complete`` round-trip, so the ``done`` event is
    emitted as soon as the last delta has been streamed. Concretely:

    - The opening turn (no member message, empty transcript) yields the
      deterministic greeting as a single delta then the greeting result,
      with no model call (mirrors :func:`run_onboarding_turn`).
    - Otherwise we open ``llm.stream(..., tools=[tool])`` and yield each
      text delta as it arrives. The streamed deltas reproduce the
      assistant's conversational reply token-by-token.
    - The terminal ``done`` event carries the fully assembled
      :class:`~integrations.services.llm.LLMResult` (text plus, on the
      final turn, ``tool_input``). We build the authoritative result from
      it via the SAME :func:`_turn_result_from_llm` helper the
      non-streaming path uses, so the persisted answers are byte-for-byte
      identical.

    This stays Django-independent (no models, no request, no ``django.db``)
    just like :func:`run_onboarding_turn`.

    Raises:
        LLMError: when opening the stream fails, the stream fails
            mid-response, or the final-turn tool input does not validate.
            A mid-stream failure (after at least one delta) surfaces as
            :class:`LLMError` from the generator so the transport can fall
            back to the non-streaming path for the same member message. No
            partial result is yielded, so the caller writes nothing.
