"""Blocking, token-cheap GitHub Actions CI watcher for on-call.

Ported from AI-Shipping-Labs/website `scripts/watch-ci.py`, adapted to this
package's pull-request checks (CI, plan-check, Cross-repo consumer check). The
process polls until a verdict and wakes the caller once, so on-call never has
to sleep, call `gh run watch`, or repeatedly poll `gh run list/view` across
agent turns.

Outcome / exit-code contract (identical to PocketShell):

    0  green        every required job present and successful/appropriately skipped
    1  failed       a genuine required-job/run failure (wins over later cancel)
    2  hang         no job-state progress deadline or max wall-clock deadline hit
    3  unresolved   input/run resolution failed or gh CLI failures exceed budget
    4  superseded   cancelled run demonstrably replaced by a newer matching run
    5  no_verdict   cancellation with no newer run, or completed-but-not-green

The module is import-safe: importing it never starts polling. Every external
dependency (the `gh` CLI and the clock) is injectable so the behaviour can be
driven by deterministic offline tests with fake GitHub responses and a virtual
clock.
